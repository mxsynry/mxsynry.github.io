A forked version of Infinite Yield that’s **better**.

# THIS IS THE SCRIPTBLOX BRANCH
You can reupload this branch, NOT our main one. sadly ScriptBlox hates the one more nsfw command
But somehow they allow nameless admin.
to re-upload YOU HAVE to add [READ DESC]
for example
```
Title: IYR Reupload [READ DESC]
Desc: [FOR THE ADMINS]
This script does not have any nsfw commands
It's another branch without it
Please do not take any action on this post
This is a script box version of IYR
[END]

IYR But better.

Features:
;weao
;slist
;infinity
;antibang
;windowfocus
```

## Loadstring:
```lua
loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RyXeleron/infiniteyield-reborn/refs/heads/scriptblox/source"))()
```

Thank you.
